ImageServer

  ImageServer allows you to store and retrieve images and perform serverside clipping and resizing.

  To use ImageServer in your product, you need to

    * deploy your own ImageServer instance, or get an account for a hosted ImageServer instance.

      If you deploy your own instance, you require a Tomcat or other servlet container and a SQL Server database.

      (TODO: specify minimal versions)

    * integrate the ImageServer client code in your product.
